# Repo Description:
A personal Git-based knowledge vault where I organize everything I learnâ€”programming languages, theoretical CS concepts (OS, OOP, DBMS), solved coding problems, Git tips, and automation scripts.

Includes auto-commit scripts for effortless versioning of notes, code, and docs. Acts as a second brain for quick reference, long-term learning, and project reuse.
